# Component Testing Strategy for AWS Services

This document provides an overview of how to approach component testing for AWS services (Step Functions, Lambda, SageMaker, and DynamoDB) using Python, Terraform, and Spinnaker for deployment.

| **AWS Service**   | **Component Testing Strategy** | **Prerequisites** | **Expected Outcome** |
|-------------------|-------------------------------|-------------------|----------------------|
| **Step Function** | - Use AWS Step Functions' *Local Testing* to simulate workflows using AWS SDKs or local tools (e.g., AWS SAM CLI).<br>- Test each state machine separately with mock data to verify state transitions.<br>- Leverage CloudWatch Logs to monitor execution results.<br>- Write unit tests for Lambda functions invoked within Step Functions using local mocking libraries (e.g., `moto` for mocking AWS services in Python). | - AWS Step Functions state machine deployed via Terraform.<br>- Local testing tools like AWS SAM CLI.<br>- Python testing libraries (unittest, pytest). | - Step Functions should invoke states correctly and transition without errors.<br>- Lambda functions within Step Functions should trigger as expected.<br>- Logs should contain correct details of state machine execution. |
| **Lambda**        | - Test Lambda functions using *AWS Lambda Test Events* and unit tests (pytest) to simulate different input scenarios.<br>- Deploy Lambda via Terraform and trigger them manually or through integrations (e.g., via Step Functions or DynamoDB stream).<br>- Test Lambda functions locally using AWS SAM CLI or the `pytest-aws-lambda` plugin for unit testing. | - Lambda function deployed via Terraform.<br>- AWS SDKs for local testing (AWS SAM, `pytest-aws-lambda`).<br>- Unit test cases covering different edge cases and inputs. | - Lambda function should execute successfully with the expected output.<br>- Errors should be handled correctly.<br>- Lambda logs should capture execution details as expected. |
| **SageMaker**     | - Test SageMaker models by invoking endpoints programmatically via `boto3` in Python.<br>- Use mock data for model inference to test the endpoint functionality.<br>- Validate if predictions match the expected results based on test inputs.<br>- For batch jobs, monitor the job's status and check the output via S3 or CloudWatch Logs. | - SageMaker endpoint deployed via Terraform.<br>- Python `boto3` or SageMaker SDK.<br>- Test data for inference and expected output. | - Endpoint should return valid inferences based on the input.<br>- SageMaker jobs (e.g., batch transform) should complete with the expected output.<br>- Logs should indicate successful inference. |
| **DynamoDB**      | - Test read operations (e.g., `get_item`, `scan`, `query`) from DynamoDB tables.<br>- Mock DynamoDB in unit tests using `moto` for Python or AWS DynamoDB Local for local testing.<br>- Perform integration tests to ensure the application handles DynamoDB interactions (e.g., reading and writing data). | - DynamoDB table created via Terraform.<br>- Local DynamoDB setup for local testing (using `moto` or DynamoDB Local).<br>- Unit test cases for reading and writing items. | - DynamoDB should return the correct data for read operations.<br>- Items should be properly written and retrieved.<br>- No errors should occur during table interactions. |
# Component Testing Strategy for AWS Services

This document provides an overview of how to approach component testing for AWS services (Step Functions, Lambda, SageMaker, DynamoDB, and Glue) using Python, Terraform, and Spinnaker for deployment.

## Additional Considerations:
- **Terraform Deployment**: Ensure Terraform scripts for each AWS service are correct and up-to-date, and use Terraform `plan` and `apply` to deploy changes. Verify resource creation in AWS.
- **Spinnaker**: Make sure your Spinnaker pipeline includes the necessary stages for each component (e.g., Lambda deployment, Step Functions workflow deployment) and validate deployment through logs and manual verification.
- **Logging and Monitoring**: Use CloudWatch for monitoring each service’s execution and logs. Also, configure proper error handling and alerting in your Terraform configurations to notify you of issues during testing.
- **Mocking AWS Services**: For unit testing, especially in Lambda functions, use libraries like `moto` to mock AWS services locally to avoid unnecessary costs and to simulate responses.
